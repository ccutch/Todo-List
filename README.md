# Todo-List App

This is a simple React.js app which uses Backbone models. Right now I am using javascripts localStorage to store data specific to the browser that it is being used in, but I would like to replace this with persistent data though Backbone models.
 
**Using**

* React.js
* Backbone.js
* Node.js
* Coffeescript


## Installation
```bash
  cd /path/to/todo-list
  npm install
  npm start
```

## Notes
This is still in a very. Early stage with only a couple hours of work put into it.
